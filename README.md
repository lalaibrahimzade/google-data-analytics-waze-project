# Waze User Churn Analysis (Google Data Analytics – Course 2)

This project was developed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera (Course 2: Get Started with Python). The objective was to inspect and analyze user churn behavior using Waze app data, applying Python-based data analysis techniques.

## 📌 Objective

To explore Waze's user activity data, identify churn patterns, and generate insights to support business decisions around user retention.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains user activity metrics such as:
- Total drives
- Driven kilometers
- Driving days
- Sessions
- Device type (Android or iPhone)
- Churn label (retained vs. churned)

> Note: The data used is simulated and intended for educational purposes only.

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed

- Data inspection using `pandas` and `numpy`
- Null value analysis and imputation insights
- Summary statistics and group comparisons
- Feature engineering:
  - `km_per_drive`
  - `km_per_driving_day`
  - `drives_per_driving_day`
- Device-based churn rate analysis
- Insight generation for business recommendations

## 📈 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Churned users drive longer distances in fewer days.
- Retained users show more frequent but shorter app usage.
- Churn pattern is not biased by device type (Android/iOS).
- Users who churn may represent high-usage segments like long-haul drivers.

## ✅ Outcome

This project demonstrates the application of Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and business insight generation using real-world-like scenarios.
